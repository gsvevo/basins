# Water Basins in the world

## Data

The original data comes from the [Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database](http://gis.nacse.org/tfdd/index.php). It is a polygon shapefile showing the water basins shared by two or more countries in the world. The simplified version was created using the mapshaper simplify tool at 5%. This dataset is part of my final project, which consists in implementing a website to visualize data contained in the database.
