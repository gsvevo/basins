#Water Basins in the world

## Data

The original data comes from the [Transboundary Freshwater Dispute Database](http://gis.nacse.org/tfdd/index.php). It is a polygon shapefile showing the water basins shared by two or more countries in the world. The original shapefile size is about 18 Mb. This dataset is part of the final project, which consists in implementing a website to visualize the data contained in the database.
